# Overview

This is a simple program I wrote to practice my Kotlin.  This is the first Kotlin program I have written
I wanted to work on classes and inheritance.  I also wanted to see if I could get intelij and github integrated together
It was a little rocky given the time restraints I had so any advice would be gladly accepted. 


Here is a link where I demo this software.
